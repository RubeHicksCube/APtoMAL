# APtoMAL
Converts Anime Planet JSON to MAL xml format

This will match titles from Anime-Planet to titles using Jikan API to what MAL uses, otherwise it will reject unmatched titles that have no MAL-ID.

Keep the exported JSON in the same directory as the script.

The script will output a convert.xml file that you can import into MAL.
